# Color
A simple website that generates random colors and gives their names when the user presses 'c'. 
Check it out in https://dylanoshima.github.io/color/!

I used a small library made by <b>Chirag Mehta</b> to get the color names. 
This is one of my practice sites so I can work on my JavaScript. 

Let me know if there are any weird bugs, but it's so simple there really shouldn't be any.

<b>WARNING: Those with epileptic tendancies I don't suggest you access this site. 
Holding of the 'c' button will cause the screen to flash rapidly. </b>
